# Gemini Debugging Log: Frontend Deployment Failure

## 1. Objective

Deploy the Next.js application located in the `/frontend` directory to Google Cloud Run.

## 2. The Problem

The deployment consistently fails during the container build process on Google Cloud Build. The command used for deployment is:
```bash
gcloud run deploy ai-trading-system-frontend --source ./frontend --region asia-northeast1 --set-env-vars NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<backend_url>
```

The build fails during the `RUN npm run build` step inside the `frontend/Dockerfile`.

## 3. The Error Message

The consistent error message received from the build logs is:
```
Error: Cannot find module '../server/require-hook'
Require stack:
- /app/node_modules/.bin/next
...
code: 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```

This indicates that the `next` executable, when run, cannot find its own required modules, suggesting an issue with the `node_modules` directory's integrity or the execution environment.

## 4. Debugging Steps Taken

The following steps were taken to diagnose and resolve the issue. Each step was followed by a new deployment attempt, which ultimately failed with the same error.

### Step 1: Correcting Dependencies

- **Observation:** The `playwright` testing library was listed under `dependencies` in `package.json`. This is a large library and should be a `devDependency`.
- **Action:** Moved `playwright` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`.

### Step 2: Fixing Missing Lockfile

- **Observation:** The initial build failed because no `package-lock.json` was present in the repository.
- **Action:** Generated `package-lock.json` by running `npm install` in the `frontend` directory. This resolved the initial "Lockfile not found" error.

### Step 3: Iterating on the Dockerfile

The `frontend/Dockerfile` was modified multiple times to address potential issues:

1.  **Initial State:** A complex multi-stage build.
2.  **Modification A:** Added `--omit=dev` to the `npm ci` command to avoid installing testing libraries in the production build. This led to the `Cannot find module` error because `next build` requires dev dependencies.
3.  **Modification B:** Reverted Modification A to ensure `devDependencies` were available during the build step. The error persisted.
4.  **Final Modification:** Completely rewrote the `Dockerfile` to a simpler, more standard, and robust two-stage build pattern to eliminate any issues with copying `node_modules` between stages.

The final, simplified `Dockerfile` is:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: builder
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install ALL dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN npm ci

# Copy the rest of the source code
COPY . .

# Disable telemetry
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: runner
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED 1

RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public

# Copy the standalone output
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/standalone .
COPY --from=builder --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/.next/static ./.next/static

USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
ENV PORT 3000
ENV HOSTNAME "0.0.0.0"
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## 5. Conclusion & Recommendation

Despite applying all standard best practices and fixes, the `Cannot find module` error persists. This indicates the problem is not a common configuration error but likely a more subtle incompatibility between this specific project's dependencies/configuration and the Google Cloud Build environment.

**The recommended next step is to debug this in a local environment:**

1.  Ensure Docker is installed on a local machine.
2.  Navigate to the `/frontend` directory.
3.  Run the command `docker build .`

This will replicate the build process locally. If it fails with the same error, it allows for much faster, interactive debugging of the `node_modules` directory and build process than is possible in the CI/CD environment.
